    "Comparison of LLM, Simple RAG, HyDE-Enhanced RAG, and Summarization-Enhanced RAG\n",
    "The evaluation of different retrieval and generation approaches highlights clear distinctions in their ability to answer questions effectively. Below, we analyze how each method performed in terms of accuracy, contextual depth, specificity, and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Baseline LLM Without RAG\n",
    "The original LLM operates without external retrieval, relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge. While it can provide general definitions and high-level insights, it struggles when asked to retrieve specific examples, such as real-world hate speech phrases or instances of offensive language. Additionally, due to ethical and safety constraints, the responses often refuse to provide explicit details, making them less useful for nuanced analysis. The LLM responses tend to be static, meaning they do not update dynamically with new data, limiting its applicability in real-time discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simple RAG (Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "The basic RAG implementation significantly improves response relevance by retrieving real-world examples from a stored dataset before passing them to the LLM for contextual generation. Unlike the standalone LLM, RAG enables the system to cite actual tweets categorized under hate speech, offensive language, or neutral speech. This enhances specificity and accuracy but introduces a dependency on the quality of retrieved documents. If the retrieval component does not surface relevant results, the LLM may still generate incomplete or misleading responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HyDE-Enhanced RAG (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)\n",
    "The HyDE-enhanced RAG goes a step further by creating a hypothetical response before performing retrieval. This additional step helps align the query more effectively with relevant documents in the vector database, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval. The improvement is most evident in cases where the query is ambiguous or lacks direct matching content in the database. Compared to simple RAG, the HyDE approach surfaces richer, more relevant examples and provides more coherent responses. However, this added complexity results in increased latency, as both a hypothetical response and a retrieval step are required before generating an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Summarization-Enhanced RAG\n",
    "The summarization-enhanced RAG modifies the retrieval pipeline by summarizing the top retrieved documents before passing them to the LLM. This ensures that the model focuses on key information, rather than processing lengthy or redundant excerpts. The summarization approach is particularly useful when responses need to be concise while still covering core themes from multiple retrieved sources. However, a downside is that some nuanced details may be lost in the summarization step, making it slightly less effective when precise information is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Baseline LLM is fast but lacks specificity and struggles with real-world examples.Simple RAG improves factual accuracy by retrieving stored examples but depends on retrieval quality. HyDE-Enhanced RAG refines retrieval for more relevant results but comes with higher computational costs Summarization-Enhanced RAG distills key points effectively but may lose some details. Overall, HyDE-Enhanced RAG offers the most accurate retrieval, whereas Summarization-Enhanced RAG provides concise responses. The best approach depends on the use case—whether accuracy or efficiency is prioritized. "
